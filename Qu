Given a number, reverse it and add it to itself unless it becomes a palindrome or number of iterations becomes more than 5.
Example 1:

Input: n = 23
Output: 55 
Explanation: reverse(23) = 32,then 32+23
= 55 which is a palindrome. 

Example 2:

Input: n = 30
Output: 33
Explanation: reverse(30) = 3,then 3+30
= 33 which is palindrome. 

returns that palindrome number if it becomes a palindrome else returns -1.
